## About
- This repository contains the official implementation of the research paper titled **"Self-Collision Aware Reaching and Pose Control in Large Workspaces using Reinforcement Learning"**. You can find the paper [here](https://github.com/Tumucin/DeepRL-Pose-Control).
- The codebase is developed and thoroughly tested using Python, along with the following libraries:
  - [stable_baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)
  - [PyBullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)
  - [panda-gym](https://github.com/qgallouedec/panda-gym)

The development and testing were performed on an Ubuntu 18.04 system.\
